| tennis.sh  | This code is a two-player game in which each player takes turns picking a number from 0 to their current score. The player with the higher number gains a point, and the first player to reach 3 points wins the game. |
| gccfind.sh | This code changes the directory to the first parameter, checks if there are enough parameters, and then searches for files with the . c extension that contain the second parameter and then compiles them.                                   |
